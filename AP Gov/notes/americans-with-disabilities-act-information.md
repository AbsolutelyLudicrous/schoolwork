## Title 1: employment

The ADA states that a "covered entity" shall not discriminate against "a qualified individual with a disability".
 This applies to job application procedures, hiring, advancement and discharge of employees, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.
 "Covered entities" include employers with 15 or more employees, as well as employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor-management committees.

Prohibited discrimination may include, among other things,
 firing or refusing to hire someone based on a real or perceived disability,
 segregation,
 and harassment based on a disability.
 Covered entities are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities.

**Part of Title I was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court as it pertains to states in the case of Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett as violating the sovereign immunity rights of the several states as specified by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.
 The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules.
 State employees can, however, file complaints at the Department of Justice or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who can sue on their behalf.**

## Title 2: public entites and transport

All **public** (e.g. schools,
 libraries,
 the city,
 the state) entities must meet accesilibilty standards.
 Covers access to *all* programs and services.

Also covers public transport, such as city buses or Amtrak;
 and housing, The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is charged with enforcing this provision.

## Title 3: public and commercial accomadations

Under Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,
 services,
 facilities,
 or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation.
 Public accommodations include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels),
 recreation,
 transportation,
 education,
 and dining,
 along with stores,
 care providers,
 and places of public displays.

All new construction after the July 1992 *must* be ADA compliant.
All old construction must be modified to be ADA compliant if the modification is readily achievable.

('Readily achievable' changes based on size of business.
Big corporations, such as Comcast, have to make their facilities *super* ADA compliant; the local mom-and-pop shop does not.)

There are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III.
 With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the "maximum extent feasible" but if following the usual standards would "threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building" then alternative standards may be used.
