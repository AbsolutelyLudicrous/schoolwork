+ Further amendments established the EPA

# Title 1: Programs and Activities

## Part A: Air Quality and Emissions Limitations

Declares that pollution is bad;
encourages prevention of pollution.
Mandates several quality control regions, which are categorized as 'attainment' or 'nonattainment'.
Attainment and nonattainment mean meeting goals and not meeting goals, respectively.
Unclassified zones also exist, largely due to lack of data.

The remaining subchapters cover smokestack heights,
 state plan adequacy,
 and estimating emissions of carbon monoxide,
 volatile organic compounds,
 and oxides of nitrogen from area and mobile sources.

## Part B: Ozone Protection

### Because of advances in the atmospheric chemistry, this section was replaced by Title VI when the law was amended in 1990.

## Part C: Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality

Permits are required to build major sources of pollution.

Goals:

0. prevent new non-attainment areas by ensuring economic growth in harmony with existing clean air;
0. protect public health and welfare from any adverse effects;
0. preserve and enhance the air quality in national parks and other areas of special natural recreational, scenic, or historic value.

## Part D: Plan Requirements for Non-attainment Areas

Under the Clean Air Act states are required to submit a plan for non-attainment areas to reach attainment status as soon as possible but in no more than five years, based on the severity of the air pollution and the difficulty posed by obtaining cleaner air.

The plan must include:

0. an inventory of all pollutants
0. permits
0. control measures, means and techniques to reach standard qualifications
0. contingency measures

# Title 2: Emission Standards for Moving Sources

## Part A: Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards

Covers standards,
 grants,
 prohibited acts,
 and available actions to restrict noncompliance;
As well as a study of offroad vehicle emissions.

This part of the bill was extremely controversial the time it was passed. The automobile industry argued that it could not meet the new standards. 
Senators expressed concern about impact on the economy.
Specific new emissions standards for moving sources passed years later.

## Part B: Aircraft Emission Standards

Airplanes output ~~chemicals to turn the freakin frogs gay!~~ **V**olatile **O**rganic **C**ompounds.
Smog is produced from airport shuttles, 
 ground support vehicles,
 and heating systems.

Title II sets emission standards for airlines and aircraft engines and adopts standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

## Part C: Clean Fuel Vehicles

Automobile exhaust is *really* bad for you.
Part C pushes for cleaner fuels.

# Title 3:

A citizen may file a lawsuit to obtain compliance with an emission standard issued by the EPA or by a state,
 unless there is an ongoing enforcement action being pursued by EPA or the appropriate state agency.

# Title 4:

This title pre-dates the Clean Air Act. 
 With the passage of the Clean Air Act, it became codified as Title IV.
 However, another Title IV was enacted in the 1990 amendments.
 The second Title IV was then appended to this Title IV as Title IV-A (see below).

This title established the EPA Office of Noise Abatement and Control to reduce noise pollution in urban areas,
 to minimize noise-related impacts on psychological and physiological effects on humans,
 effects on wildlife and property (including values),
 and other noise-related issues. 
The agency was also assigned to run experiments to study the effects of noise.

## Title 4A: Acid Deposition Control

Addresses the issue of acid rain.

# Title 5: Permits

Handles the national permit system.
Consolidates the pre-T5 documents into a single permit application.
In non-attainment areas, permits were required for sources that emit as little as 50,
 25,
 or 10 tons per year of VOCs depending on the severity of the regionâ€™s non-attainment status.

# Title 6: Stratospheric Ozone Protection

Regulate chemicals which harm the ozone layer.

The ozone-destroying chemicals were classified into two groups,
Class I and Class II.
Class I consists of substances, including chlorofluorocarbons, that have an ozone depletion potential (ODP) (HL) of 0.2 or higher.
Class II lists substances, including hydrochlorofluorocarbons, that are known to or may be detrimental to the stratosphere.
Both groups have a timeline for phase-out.
