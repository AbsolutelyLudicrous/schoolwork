# TItle 1: Programs and Activities

## Part A: Air Quality and Emissions Limitations

Declares that pollution is bad;
encourages prevention of pollution.
Mandates several quality control regions, which are categorized as 'attainment' or 'nonattainment'.
Attainment and nonattainment mean meeting goals and not meeting goals, respectively.
Unclassified zones also exist, largely due to lack of data.

The remaining subchapters cover smokestack heights,
 state plan adequacy,
 and estimating emissions of carbon monoxide,
 volatile organic compounds,
 and oxides of nitrogen from area and mobile sources.

## Part B: Ozone Protection

### Because of advances in the atmospheric chemistry, this section was replaced by Title VI when the law was amended in 1990.[

## Part C: Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality

Permits are required to build major sources of pollution.

Goals:

0. prevent new non-attainment areas by ensuring economic growth in harmony with existing clean air;
0. protect public health and welfare from any adverse effects;
0. preserve and enhance the air quality in national parks and other areas of special natural recreational, scenic, or historic value.

## Part D: Plan Requirements for Non-attainment Areas

Under the Clean Air Act states are required to submit a plan for non-attainment areas to reach attainment status as soon as possible but in no more than five years, based on the severity of the air pollution and the difficulty posed by obtaining cleaner air.

The plan must include:

0. an inventory of all pollutants
0. permits
0. control measures, means and techniques to reach standard qualifications
0. contingency measures
