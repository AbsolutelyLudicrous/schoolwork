Director Guess,


I am M. Danne, a self-described privacy nut and crypto nerd. Recently, unfortunately, there has been an epidemic of mass shootings in this nation. With them, the question of how these tragedies could have been prevented is invariably flung to the forefront of public conscience. Every time, some pundits will ask for encryption-weakening legislation to be passed; for the government to effectively be given a "master key" to every citizen's smartphone. 


I am firmly of the belief that such legislation would be, not only stupid and against the laws of mathematics, a violation of our Constitutional rights. Specifically, freedom of expression and right to privacy. Why has the ACLU not done anything to combat these bills? 


Privacy is essential to democracy; as a concerned citizen I would like to see greater support for it. Please, combat encryption weakening legislation; and thank you for taking the time to read this.


Sincerely,



M. Danne
