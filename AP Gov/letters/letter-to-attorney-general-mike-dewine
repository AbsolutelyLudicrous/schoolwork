Attorney General Dewine,


	I'm M. Danne, a UNIX nerd with an interest in politics who has noticed some of your more interesting positions. I would like to know more about your current stances on the issues of gay marriage and gun control.

	I, despite disagreeing with your opposition to gay marriage, want to know on what you base your opposition and how it has changed over time. Is it a deeply held personal belief, or is it a stance you feel forced to take so that you can best represent the majority of Ohioans? WVXU, a radio station, has you quoted in 2013 as saying "The voters of Ohio voted on this and they made their decision. It's my obligation to defend that decision until or unless the voters change their mind." After a 2014 poll of Ohioans found that more than half the state supported gay marriage, did you change your position? 


	Attorney General, you also apparently disagree with your party on the topic of gun control. You supported the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, authored SB 954, and got called the tenth most anti-gun politician in the Senate by conservative magazine Human Events. These stances are extremely atypical for a Republican political figure. What led you to break so far from your party, and has it caused you any issues?


	I hope that none of these questions have come off as combative, I take a genuine interest in your answers. I look forward to seeing your responses to my questions; thank you for your time.


Sincerely,



M. Danne
