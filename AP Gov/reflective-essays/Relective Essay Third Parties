<center> Reflection on "Why Americans should support third parties </center>

Why Americans should support third parties, by constitutional law professor Mark R. Brown, is a short article arguing that, even though they have no chance of victory, Americans should vote for minor (non-Democrat, non-Republican) parties.
Brown's thesis is in their title, that "Americans should support third parties"(1).
Brown bases this claim on their assertions that the major parties, Democrats and Republicans, do not best represent the majority of Americans, and that third-party candidates are not the "spoilers" that the major parties have made them out to be.
Their thesis is largely correct: the major parties need improvement, neither major party is perfect; however, third-party candidates are spoilers, though that isn't necesarily a bad thing.
This can be clearly shown by the relatively high number of independent-identifying Americans; and the American presidential elections of 1884, 1916, and 2000.

Brown states: 

Neither major party entirely represents the views of most Americans.
People tend to align themselves as Democrat or Republican for the sake of simplicity, not because they are wholly Democrat or Republican.
