The American Electoral College needs to be reformed, not destroyed.
On several occaisions, the Electoral College result diverged from the popular vote, much to the displeasure of the people.
Additionally, there are several more occaisions where the Electoral College very nearly diverged from the popular vote.

For some reason, people take issue with this.
Some political analysts call for the abolition of the Electoral College entirely, others merely call for reform.
One thing both groups agree on is that the current Electoral College is problematic.

The Electoral College is undemocratic, this is both intentional and a good thing.
The Electoral College gives a voice to smaller states, who may otherwise be ignored by presidential candidates, and acts as a gatekeeper for the highest office in the land.
The founding fathers believed that the general populace was literally incapable of selecting an apt president.
Founder George Mason claimed that it would be equivalent to asking a blind person to differentiate colors.
Because the Founders didn't trust the populace, they instituted the Electoral College in 1789.

It didn't take too long for the Electoral College to cause controversy, in 1800 Jefferson and Burr both won the offices of President and Vice-President.
Of course, each person could not occupy two offices, especially not the two highest offices of the United States.
A compromise was reached, with Jefferson becoming the third President of the United States.
The whole Jefferson-Burr ordeal resulted in the Twelfth Amendment to the United States' Constitution, which totally overhauled the selection of the President and Vice-President.
