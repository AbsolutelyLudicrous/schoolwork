The American Electoral College needs to be reformed, not destroyed.
On several occaisions, the Electoral College result diverged from the popular vote, much to the displeasure of the people.
Additionally, there are several more occaisions where the Electoral College very nearly diverged from the popular vote.

For some reason, people take issue with this.
Some political analysts call for the abolition of the Electoral College entirely, others merely call for reform.
One thing both groups agree on is that the current Electoral College is problematic.

The Electoral College is undemocratic, this is both intentional and a good thing.
The Electoral College gives a voice to smaller states, who may otherwise be ignored by presidential candidates, and acts as a gatekeeper for the highest office in the land.
The founding fathers believed that the general populace was literally incapable of selecting an apt president.
Founder George Mason claimed that it would be equivalent to asking a blind person to differentiate colors.
Because the Founders didn't trust the populace, they instituted the Electoral College in 1789.

It didn't take too long for the Electoral College to cause controversy, in 1800 Jefferson and Burr both won the offices of President and Vice-President.
Of course, each person could not occupy two offices, especially not the two highest offices of the United States.
A compromise was reached, with Jefferson becoming the third President of the United States.
The whole Jefferson-Burr ordeal resulted in the Twelfth Amendment to the United States' Constitution, which totally overhauled the selection of the President and Vice-President.

Despite this, and other controversies, the Electoral College still exists largely in its original form.
Every state gets a number of electors equal to its total stake in Congress, the number of House Representatives plus two Senators.
The electors then vote for the President and Vice-President.
In theory, anyone except a federal officeholder can be an elector, in practice this leads to political parties choosing electors.
Come November, the people vote on a set of electors who have promised to vote for one particular Presidential candidate.
Electors are not required to vote for their party's candidate, but face severe political repurcussions if they choose not to.
Such electors are called "faithless electors", a term with serious stigma attached to it.
Anybody labeled a faithless elector stands much worse chances of winning public office in the future.

It is possible that the Electoral College fails to achieve a majority for any candidate, as has famously happened in the "Corrupt Bargain" of 1824.
In such a situation, the House of Representatives votes for the President and the Senate votes for the Vice-President.

Regardless of whether the Electoral College is a good thing or not, it has become too integral to the American political system to remove.
The Electoral College can not be safely removed, and so should be appreciated, as it has many positives.

The Electoral College lowers the number of parties, reducing politics to a strict binary.
Because electors are allocated winner-take-all style, the only way for a third party to gain electors is to win an entire state.
Voting for a third party is considered a waste of one's vote, as the third party can not feasably win.
The Electoral College prevents Americans from voting with their true feelings and instead voting for a major party.
Other nations lack this political binary, and have more active third parties.
Third parties are bad, because they allow minority groups to gain power.
