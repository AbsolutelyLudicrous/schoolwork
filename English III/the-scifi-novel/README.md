#Working title!

A good buddy of mine told me to write a book, so I did!

As I write this readme I am slowly crossing the line from tired into wired, so I'll keep things brief.

##The problem with (most) sci-fi:

Y'alls sci-fi writers have no sense of scale.

Or of how awesome real life is, anyways.

Sure, a kilometer-long spaceship might seem big, but it's way too small for interstellar travel.
X-Wings are nifty and all but where's all the fuel?
The Enterprise might seem big, but 100m is really tiny!
NASA's Constellation mission mothership, the Copernicus, was specced to be that long and Copernicus could barely do a Mars run!

Bigger is better, right?
So why don't sci-fi writers take advantage of it?!

Your kilometer-long Star Destroyer will quiver before the might of my 700km long antimatter-driven [Frisbee proposal](https://web.archive.org/web/20060601234257/http://www.aiaa.org/Participate/Uploads/2003-4676.pdf).

Cry me a river, Gene Roddenberry, V'Ger will look like a puny-ass bitch.

##Design philosophy:

**Keep it realistic.**

Meaning:

+ No interstellar direct-ascent designs!
The whole starship should *not* land on planet Fuckall VI.

+ Deal with your engine!
Your engine is a badass glowing torch of deadly radioactive high-speed fucking-hot-as-hell hydrogen.
Shield yourself from it.
Use it.
See: [The Kziti Lesson](http://projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunexotic.php#propulsion).

+ No FTL travel!
FTL travel is time travel, for complicated reasons I should describe somewhere.
And time travel does not make for realitic sci-fi, so it's absolutely verboten.

+ Your spaceship will be largely fuel and reaction mass.
To get places quickly, you need a lot of delta-v.
To have a lot of dV, you need a lot of shit to toss into your engine.
