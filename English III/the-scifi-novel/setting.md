#Working Title

Okay, okay, every sci-fi novel needs a setting, right?
Hell, every *novel* needs a setting.
Does every novel need a setting?
I digress.

**We** need a setting.

Here's what I'm thinking:

+ **The year is 2169**, two-hundred years after humankind first stepped foot on the Moon.

+ There is war in indochina.
The Korea situation boiled over, it doesn't matter who started it, we won't talk about indochina much.
I needed a way to take China out of the sociopolitical game and figured this was a good-enough solution.

+ Large portions of Earth have become covered in sprawling metropolises.
The largest of these is Moskva-Lyon, a massive "city" stretching from former eastern Russia to former southern France.
The second largest is Louis-Ottowa, which spans the gap between the former American heartland and the former capital of former Canada.

+ Chemical Rockets are *so* last century.
While actual launch methods will vary, I plan on using largely [bifrost bridges](http://luf.org/bifrost.php) or [slingatrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch#Hybrid_launch_systems) for Earth launch.
Lower-gravity bodies can just use conventional chemical launchers.

+ The Equator has been encircled with a ring of floating barges.
The barges are described in detail in the `ground-vehicles.md` file.
Most are coated in solar panels, some are bristling with anti-sat weapons, some serve other purposes.
We won't talk about these much, they serve as an ex-machina and a backup power solution for...

+ *The Mercury Splaser!*
(**S**olar **P**owered **laser**)
Mercury's been colonised, and we stuck a big-ol' laser on it.
Why?
Beamed power!
Also laser-light-sail propulsion.
We'll use the Splaser for some part of the outbound interstellar trip.

+ The Earth's Moon, *Luna*, is hella colonised.
Two [Space-fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_fountain) stations are located high over the poles of Luna.
Each has a receiving dish for the Splaser.
Each beams power to receiving dishes on the Earth's surface.
Earthlings get panicky about having the Splaser pointed at them, so Luna is used as an intermediary relay.
Plus beam diffusion would make a direct Mercury -> Earth beam unsafe.
