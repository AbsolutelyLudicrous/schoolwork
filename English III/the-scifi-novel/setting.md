#Working Title

Okay, okay, every sci-fi novel needs a setting, right?
Hell, every *novel* needs a setting.
Does every novel need a setting?
I digress.

**We** need a setting.

Here's what I'm thinking:

---

## Super big-picture stuff

+ **The year is 2169**, two-hundred years after humankind first stepped foot on the Moon.

---

## Geopolitical stuff:

+ China and the EU hate the USA/Canada conglomerate.

+ The United States merged with Canada due to sanctions from China and the EU.
It's compicated, but basically it would have been challenging for the two countries to survive independently.
Really it's more of a confederation.
The confederation is officially named "The Confederation of the North-American States and Territories", but commonly called "Americanada".

+ Americanada has taken over the Panama Canal, again.
Reasons: Space launch and tariffs.
This is what causes the EU to hate Americanada in the first place.

+ There is war in indochina.
The Korea situation boiled over, it doesn't matter who started it, we won't talk about indochina much.
I needed a way to take China out of the geopolitical game and figured this was a good-enough solution.

---

## Earthy stuff:

+ Large portions of Earth have become covered in sprawling metropolises.
The largest of these is Moskva-Lyon, a massive "city" stretching from former eastern Russia to former southern France.
The second largest is Louis-Ottowa, which spans the gap between the former American heartland and the former capital of former Canada.

---

## Spacey stuff:

+ Chemical Rockets are *so* last century.
While actual launch methods will vary, I plan on using largely [bifrost bridges](http://luf.org/bifrost.php) or [slingatrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch#Hybrid_launch_systems) for Earth launch.
Lower-gravity bodies can just use conventional chemical launchers.

+ *The Mercury Splaser!*
(**S**olar **P**owered **laser**)
Mercury's been colonised, and we stuck a big-ol' laser on it.
Why?
Beamed power!
Also laser-light-sail propulsion.
We'll use the Splaser for some part of the outbound interstellar trip.

+ The Earth's Moon, *Luna*, is hella colonised.
Two [Space-fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_fountain) stations are located high over the poles of Luna.
Each has a receiving dish for the Splaser.
Each beams power to receiving dishes on the Earth's surface.
Earthlings get panicky about having the Splaser pointed at them, so Luna is used as an intermediary relay.
Plus beam diffusion would make a direct Mercury -> Earth beam unsafe.
