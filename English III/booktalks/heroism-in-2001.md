*2001: A Space Odyssey* tells the harrowing tale of a one-way exploratory mission to Jupiter\*.
Heroism in *2001* manifests through the crew's willingness to even take the mission and handling of certain events during the mission.
Late in the novel, the crew must handle an issue with the health of their vessel:
the ship's computer had started to kill the crew.
Eventually, the remaining crew must overpower the computer, which begins to repeat the phrase, "I'm afraid, Dave"(Clarke 197), until it is forcibly shut down.
The crew demonstrates heroism by destroying the object which enables their mission, both saving their lives and complicating their suicide mission.
