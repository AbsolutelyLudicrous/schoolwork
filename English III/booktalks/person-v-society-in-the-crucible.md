*The Crucible* is a play all about person-vs.-society conflict.
The play features a society which chooses one of its members to be tried as a witch,
the accused then has to deal with an ordeal of a trial.
The accused is usually convicted.
In short, the society chooses a person to kill.
An example of this attitude can be found in the quote "The Deputy Governor promise hangin' if they'll not confess, John. The town's gone wild, I think."(Miller 193).
The quote shows the murderous frenzy present in the society of *The Crucible*, that the society will hang a person it deems undesirable.
