Hey howdy, I'm sorry for the confusion.
I've been meaning to send this email for some time, but fear and dread have kept me from doing so.

It doesn't seem like that's much of an option anymore.

Mr. Bookmyer, I'm transgender.

Nonbinary, specifically.
I don't fully identify as a man or a woman, I'm just me.

This statement isn't absurd, or a joke, or anything.
It's the truth.

I can provide loads of links validating the existence of nonbinary genders, if need be.
I'll just provide a few, because I know that nonbinary identities can seem absurd at first glance.
In general, my favorite is [this blog post](https://ticki.github.io/blog/the-case-for-non-binary-genders/), just because of how clear and concise it is.
There's also [this entry in the Rational Wiki about nonbinary identies being in a number of religious texts](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender#In_Islamic_texts), which is great for showing how nonbinary identies are not some hip fad.
If blog posts and Wikipedia knock-offs aren't your thing, [Psychology Today ran an article on the topic all the way back in 2015.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201503/none-the-above)

I use "they" pronouns: "they", "them", "themself", etc.
Fortunately, the English language has a gender-neutral singular "they".
See [this excellent website for a plain-language summary](http://singularthey.info/), [or skim the Wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)

To address your talk today, dude, you're awesome.

I realize that I'm kind of coming out out of the blue.
I realize how weird it must be for all this to happen in the middle of the year.
I realize how frustrating it must be trying to handle pronouns and stuff, especially with no guidance from administration.

I'm very sorry.

The reason for that is that I only started questioning in late September.
Every day I curse myself for not doing so sooner, thinking about if I only could have just had things handled at the start of the year.

To address something you said to me a few weeks back, it's okay that you didn't know.
For the longest time *I* didn't even know.
You're actually the first teacher I've come out to, so this is partially a test run for me.

In short: mornin'!, I'm Danne and I use "they" pronouns.

Feel extremely free to ask me any questions you may have.

As for what happens next, I'll shoot an email to Mrs. Bauer about me being out to you now, she might send you an email with guidelines and stuff.

A bit farther in the future, I guess this would be the right time to tell you I'll be out on Wednesday the 17th for a certain doctor's appointment [(which I'm totally not counting the days until.)]()
