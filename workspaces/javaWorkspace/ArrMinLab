I feel like this is the wrong assignment, but it is 23:00 and I
don't deserve to pass this class.
a)
	for(int i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
		if(arr[i].equals("Michael Jackson"){
			//do whatever
		}else{
			//other thing
		}
b)
	Null pointer.  It means we found a value of null, which Java hates.
	It could be fixed by wrapping the whole program in a try-catch.
