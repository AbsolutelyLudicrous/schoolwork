Hey hey hey

If you're getting this email, it's because I'm out to you as trasngender.

I just need to update you on two things, names and pronouns.

---

I got a first name finally.
I'm named Eostre now.
I pronounce it as "Ess-tihr".

I originally came out as just Danne, that was because I hadn't chosen a first name yet.
Sorry about that.

I'm still okay with going by Danne, just for this year, because I'm still largely closeted in many of my classes.

---

I got a new set of pronouns, too.
I now use both they/them and she/her.
