Hey hey hey

I need to update you on two things, and ask two questions.

---

First of all, I got a name finally.
I'm Eostre now.

I pronounce it as "Ess-tihr".

Also I got a new set of pronouns, I now use both they/them and she/her pronouns.

---

I have yet another name-related question, and a bathroom question.

What do I do if the name change paperwork goes through after school ends?
I don't want to start next year as my birth name, and would like to take care of that before school starts again.
How would I get the paperwork to your registrar over the summer, if I needed to?

I can't use the clinic bathroom, it's not private at all and I get some weird looks.
It's not pleasant, so I've been avoiding it.
