Hallo!

Ich w√ºrde diese e-mail auf Deutsch schicken, aber es ist zu wichtig und meine Deutsch ist nicht genug.

Frau Engberg, when you get the National German Exam results back, you'll notice a student named "M Danne" who has their gender marked as female.
Hopefully you'll see that they ranked highly.

That student is me.

Frau Engberg, I'm transgender.

Nonbinary, specifically.
I don't fully identify as a man or a woman, I'm just me.
The reason I marked myself as female is that I'd rather not call myself a man.

This statement isn't absurd, or a joke, or anything.
It's the truth.

I can provide loads of links validating the existence of nonbinary genders, if need be.
I'll just provide two, because I know that nonbinary identities can seem absurd at first glance.
In general, my favorite is [this blog post](https://ticki.github.io/blog/the-case-for-non-binary-genders/), just because of how clear and concise it is.
If blog posts aren't your thing, [Psychology Today ran an article on the topic all the way back in 2015.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201503/none-the-above)

I prefer to just go by my last name, Danne.

I immensely dislike my legal first name, but have been stuck on choosing a new one for the past few months.

In English, I take singular "they" pronouns: they, them, their, etc.
Contrary to popular belief, ["they" actually can refer to a singular person](singularthey.info/), and has been used since Chaucer.

^((Interestingly, singular they has been used since the 14th century, but only started to receive criticism in the 19th century.))

Unfortunately, German has no singular gender neutral pronouns.
In German, I'll take anything except "er".
Sie (she), es, sie (plural they), or even just my name.

The school administration knows, as do some other teachers and most of my acquaintances.
I can have Ms. Bauer send you an email, if you'd like.

If you have any questions at all, feel free to email me or pull me aside in class.
